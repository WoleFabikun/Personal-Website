Local to Boston, MA, I am a senior at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, where I am pursuing a degree in Computer Science . My journey has been marked by a passion for programming and innovation, driving me to explore the world of software engineering. My role as a first-generation student has inspired me to surpass boundaries and set the best example possible for my three younger siblings. Guided by my Nigerian roots, I actively embrace cultural inclusivity through involvement in prominent minority organizations, such as being the Outreach Chair for my National Society of Black Engineers chapter.

As a Software Research Intern at the [Laboratory for Advanced System Software](https://lass.cs.umass.edu/), I am involved in projects that focus on issues in operating systems, distributed systems, networking, mobile systems, web and multimedia. 

Last summer, I had an opportunity to step into the realm of industry, as a Developer Intern at [Nucor Skyline](https://nucor.com/). There I learned a lot about data engineering. An apex of my contribution was crafting a dynamic credit Dashboard, enhancing sales analysis accuracy by an impressive 20%. 

When I am not programming, you can find me at the gym, [fashion modeling](/fashion), watching anime, rating cinema and music, or teaching/coaching within the Stoughton Schools District. My favorite anime right now is a triple tie between [Vinland Saga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vinland_Saga_(TV_series)), [One Piece](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Piece), and [Jujutsu Kaisen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jujutsu_Kaisen). My favorite artists currently are [Jordan Ward](https://genius.com/artists/Jordan-ward), [Smino](https://genius.com/artists/Smino), and [Bakar](https://genius.com/artists/Bakar).

I am currently seeking a full time software engineering role after my graduation in May 2024. I welcome any opportunity to work with others in the industry. If you are interested in working with me, please do not hesitate to reach out!
