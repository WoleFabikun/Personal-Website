Approaching the completion of my Computer Science degree at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, I am fully immersed in software development. My role as a Christian and first-generation student has inspired me to surpass boundaries and set the best example possible for my three younger siblings. Guided by my Nigerian roots, I actively embrace cultural inclusivity through involvement in prominent minority organizations, such as being the Outreach Chair for my National Society of Black Engineers chapter.

My fascination with generative AI has notably increased, especially since joining [Novy](https://www.linkedin.com/company/novyai/), a tech group formed in response to the fast-paced developments in the field. At Novy, we focus on helping clients gain significant competitive advantages through the latest in language, audio, and image processing technologies. Our work encompasses everything from creative initiatives to extensive automation projects, and we're in collaboration with OpenAI.

I am currently on a team, working on [Paidleave.ai](https://paidleave.ai/), a chatbot initiative in collaboration with Moms First and OpenAI, featured in Forbes, Time Magazine, and Fortune for simplifying New York's intricate paid leave policies, with ongoing expansion to 8 additional states and D.C.

When I am not programming you can find me tending to my plants, [fashion modeling](/fashion), watching anime, reviewing cinema, listening to music, or teaching/coaching within the Stoughton Schools District. My favorite anime right now is a triple tie between [Vinland Saga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vinland_Saga_(TV_series)), [One Piece](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Piece), and [Jujutsu Kaisen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jujutsu_Kaisen). My favorite artists currently are [Jordan Ward](https://genius.com/artists/Jordan-ward), [Smino](https://genius.com/artists/Smino), and [Bakar](https://genius.com/artists/Bakar). My favorite movies right now are [Interstellar](https://letterboxd.com/film/interstellar/), [Dune 2](https://letterboxd.com/film/dune-part-two/), and [The Iron Claw](https://letterboxd.com/film/the-iron-claw-2023/).

I am currently seeking a full time software engineering role after my graduation in May 2024. I welcome any opportunity to work with others in the industry. If you are interested in working with me, please do not hesitate to reach out!
