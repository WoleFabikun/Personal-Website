description: 'This script uses the Spotify API to generate a new playlist based on the users recent Spotify listening history. The program allows the user to choose up to 10 tracks they recently listened to and then select up to five of those tracks as "seed" tracks for the new playlist. The script then generates a new playlist with recommended tracks based on the seed tracks.'
