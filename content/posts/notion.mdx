If you're not already familiar with Notion, it's a powerful tool for organizing and managing your work and personal life. With Notion, you can create notes, documents, and to-do lists and then organize them into customizable workflows.

Notion has quickly become my go-to tool for staying on top of my schedule and staying organized. I've tried many other productivity tools and systems over the years, but none of them have been as versatile and effective as Notion.

## **THE BASICS**

Here are just a few of the ways that Notion has helped me stay organized and on top of my schedule, and how it can help you too:

1. The calendar feature is a game-changer. I used to struggle to keep track of my schedule and make sure I didn't miss any important deadlines. But with Notion's calendar, it's easy to see what's coming up and plan accordingly.
2. The to-do list feature is equally helpful. I tend to forget about things I need to do unless I write them down. Notion's to-do list keeps everything in one place and even allows me to set reminders for tasks.
3. Notion is great for managing projects. I'm often working on multiple projects at a time, and Notion helps me keep track of each one and all its associated tasks. Plus, I can easily share projects with others and collaborate with them.
4. One of the best things about Notion is that it's suitable for users of all levels. If you're new to productivity tools, you can get started with Notion in just a few minutes. But if you're more advanced or looking for a tailored solution, you can create complex workflows and databases to suit your needs.
5. The Notion community is a valuable resource for learning how to use the tool. There are many people who use Notion, and they're always happy to help out and share their knowledge. In fact, there are plenty of pre-made templates available if you want to set up a page but don't know where to start.

## **THE DETAILS**

As you can see, I use Notion to keep track of my classes, projects, spending habits, and more all in one place. I can easily see what I need to do and when I need to do it. I can also see what I've completed and what's still on my to-do list. This helps me stay on top of my schedule and stay focused. I can also easily share my page with others and collaborate with them.

This is most explicit in my semester pages.

This first part gives me useful information that I take in; most of the stuff here is information I know with certainty but always enjoy having to combat moments of confusion. It's also connected to a larger framework. The courses tab takes in data from several databases that hold my course path through my years at Northeastern and the courses for this specific semester.

With it, comes lectures and lecture notes that I can access, review and take advantage of (yes, I take notes on my math courses usually). <math>Latex</math> is a potent tool that is integrated into Notion.

This next part of my Notion setup is where I keep track of my coursework for the semester. As soon as I receive my syllabus at the beginning of the term, I add all the due dates and assignments to this page. This allows me to constantly track what I need to do and how much time I have left to complete it.

While it does take some time upfront to set up my Notion schedule in this way, it's well worth the effort. Not only does it save me time and stress in the long run, but it also helps me maintain a consistent and organized approach to my coursework.

Notion is a powerful and versatile tool for organizing and managing your work and personal life. With its calendar, to-do list, project management, and collaboration features, Notion has helped me stay on top of my schedule and stay organized. Whether you're a beginner or a more advanced user, Notion has something to offer.

As you can see from my own setup, Notion can be customized to fit your needs and help you stay organized in every aspect of your life. So if you're looking for a tool to boost your productivity and keep your work and personal life in order, give Notion a try. You won't regret it.
