I recently wrapped up my first tech internship at Nucor Business Technology, and let me tell you, it's been quite the ride. From diving into project execution to understanding the magic of teamwork and the importance of testing, I've gained insights that go way beyond writing lines of code.

One big takeaway? Projects aren't just about coding. It's about collaborating with different departments, managing permissions and scope, and ensuring top-notch quality through testing. And the best part? Personal growth is a big part of the package. I've leveled up in ways I never thought possible, and I'm walking away with a stronger skill set and the confidence to take on new challenges.

I've had a blast at Nucor, and I'm excited to carry these lessons into my senior year and my journey towards becoming a software or data engineer. Here's to learning, growing, and making an impact in the tech world!
